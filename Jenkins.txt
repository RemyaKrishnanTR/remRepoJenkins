🔹 CI (Continuous Integration)
Developers push code frequently to a shared repo (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).
Each commit triggers:
Automated tests
Compilation
Build process

Goal: detect bugs early and ensure smooth integration of new code.

🔹 Continuous Delivery
After CI, the code is built, tested, and packaged (for example, as a Docker image).
The system is always in a “deployable” state.
But a human decides when to release to production.
Example: QA team reviews → then approves release.

🔹 Continuous Deployment
Similar to Continuous Delivery: code is built, tested, and packaged.
Difference: no manual intervention.
If all automated tests pass → it is automatically deployed to production.
Example: code merged → pipeline runs → app is live.

✅ Key Difference
Continuous Delivery → Deployment is manual (human approval needed).
Continuous Deployment → Deployment is automatic (if tests pass, goes live).

👉 In your diagram:
“Docker Image is ready” → output of CI/CD pipeline.
From there:
Goes into Continuous Delivery (human approval).
Or into Continuous Deployment (automatic release).


🚀 Example: CI/CD Pipeline for a Web Application
1. Continuous Integration (CI)
Source Code: Developers push code to GitHub.
CI Tool: Jenkins (or GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, etc.) picks up changes.

Pipeline Steps:
Checkout code from GitHub
Run unit tests (JUnit, PyTest, Mocha, etc.)
Static code analysis (SonarQube, ESLint, Checkstyle)
Build artifact (Maven JAR/WAR, npm build, etc.)
Build Docker image (e.g., docker build -t myapp:v1 .)
Push Docker image to a Container Registry (DockerHub, ECR, GCR)

✅ Result: Docker image is ready and stored in the registry.

2. Continuous Delivery (CD)
The Docker image is deployed to a staging environment (Kubernetes cluster or VM).

Steps:
Jenkins deploys using kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
Run integration tests (API tests, Selenium tests, Postman tests)
Run performance tests if needed

✅ The application is production-ready but NOT automatically deployed.
Human (release manager/QA) reviews → clicks “Approve Deploy” in Jenkins/GitHub Actions.
3. Continuous Deployment
If you enable full automation, then after passing all tests:
Jenkins automatically runs:
kubectl apply -f k8s/production-deployment.yaml
Or uses Helm for rolling upgrades.
✅ No human step → goes straight to production.

🔗 Flow Summary
Developer → GitHub → Jenkins CI
Build → Test → Docker → Push to Registry
Deploy to Staging → Automated Tests
Continuous Delivery: Wait for human approval
Continuous Deployment: Auto-deploy to Production

✅ Key Difference:
Continuous Delivery → Needs human approval before production.
Continuous Deployment → No human step, goes live automatically.

⚡ Example Tools for Each Stage:
CI → Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI

🔹 What is a Build Automation Tool?
A Build Automation Tool is software that automates the process of building applications.
Instead of manually compiling code, running tests, packaging, and deploying — a build automation tool handles all of it in a consistent, repeatable way.

🔹 Why Do We Need Build Automation?
Manually building a project means:
Compiling source code (javac for Java).
Running unit tests.
Creating JAR/WAR files.
Managing dependencies.
Deploying to servers or repositories.
⚡ Doing this by hand is time-consuming and error-prone. Build automation tools solve this by providing a standard process.

🔹 Common Build Automation Tools
Apache Maven → XML-based, lifecycle + dependency management.
Gradle → Groovy/Kotlin DSL, faster, widely used in Android & Java projects.
Ant → Older, XML-based, more manual configurations.
MSBuild → For .NET projects.
Bazel, SBT, Make → Used in other ecosystems.

🔹 Maven as a Build Automation Tool
Maven is the most common build tool in Java projects. It handles:
Build lifecycle (phases: validate → compile → test → package → install → deploy).
Dependency management (downloads required libraries automatically).
Project structure standardization (convention over configuration).
Integration with CI/CD (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.).

⚡ Example:
	mvn clean install

👉 Cleans the project, compiles code, runs tests, packages into JAR/WAR, and installs into local repo.

✅ In short:
A Build Automation Tool is like a robot that compiles, tests, packages, and deploys your project automatically, ensuring consistency across environments.
Maven is a build automation tool widely used in Java projects for managing builds, dependencies, and project lifecycles.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

🔹 Maven Build Lifecycle
Maven has 3 built-in lifecycles:
default → for project deployment (most commonly used)
clean → for cleaning up build artifacts
site → for creating project documentation
Each lifecycle has phases (steps). A phase represents a stage in the build process.

🔹 Key Maven Phases (Default Lifecycle)
Here’s the sequence you’ll mostly use:
validate – Validate project structure and configuration.
compile – Compile the source code (src/main/java).
test – Run unit tests (src/test/java). Uses frameworks like JUnit/TestNG.
package – Package the compiled code (e.g., JAR, WAR).
verify – Run checks to ensure the package is valid.
install – Install the package into the local Maven repository (~/.m2/repository).
deploy – Deploy to a remote repository (for sharing with other developers/teams).

🔹 Clean Lifecycle
pre-clean → Do things before cleaning.
clean → Remove target/ directory (compiled classes, packaged files).
post-clean → Do things after cleaning.

🔹 Site Lifecycle
pre-site → Do things before generating documentation.
site → Generate project documentation.
post-site → Do things after site generation.
site-deploy → Deploy documentation to a web server.

🔹 How Maven Runs Phases
If you run:
	mvn install
👉 Maven will execute all phases up to install in order:

validate → compile → test → package → verify → install

If you run:
	mvn clean install
👉 Maven will first run the clean lifecycle, then the default lifecycle up to install.


⚡ Example in context of a Selenium Automation Framework:
compile → Compiles your automation code.
test → Executes your TestNG/JUnit test cases.
package → Creates a .jar or .war of your automation suite.
install → Makes it available locally (other projects can use it).
deploy → Pushes to remote repo (e.g., Nexus/Artifactory).

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

🔹 1. What happens when you push code to GitHub?

By itself, pushing code to GitHub just updates your repository.
👉 Nothing is automatically built/tested unless you have a CI/CD pipeline (like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.).

In a CI/CD pipeline:
Code is pulled from GitHub.
Build tool (like Maven/Gradle) runs.
Phases are executed: compile → test → package → install/deploy.
Results (reports, artifacts) are generated.

🔹 2. Maven Phases in CI/CD
compile → Converts your .java source files → .class bytecode files.
test → Runs unit tests (JUnit/TestNG) to verify code logic.
package → Bundles everything into a distributable format.
JAR (.jar) → Java ARchive (library or standalone app).
WAR (.war) → Web Application ARchive (for web apps, deployable on Tomcat, Jetty, JBoss, etc.).
EAR (.ear) → Enterprise ARchive (for enterprise apps, deployable on WebLogic, WebSphere).


🔹 3. Why is a WAR created?
WAR is created only if your project is a web application (e.g., Spring MVC, Servlets, JSPs).
Inside WAR:
Compiled classes (/WEB-INF/classes).
Libraries (/WEB-INF/lib).
Web resources (HTML, JSP, CSS, JS).
Deployment descriptor (web.xml).

Use:
WAR file is deployed to a Servlet Container (Tomcat, Jetty) or Application Server (JBoss, WebLogic).
Server unpacks the WAR and makes your web app accessible via a URL.

⚡ Example:
If you push a Spring Boot web app → GitHub Actions → mvn clean package → WAR generated → deployed to Tomcat → app runs at http://localhost:8080/yourapp.

✅ In short:
When you push code to GitHub (with CI/CD setup):
	Code is compiled.
	Tests run to catch bugs.
	package creates JAR/WAR so the application can be deployed and run on servers.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>	
	
🔹 Flow in an Automation Framework
When you run:
	mvn clean package
Here’s what happens step by step:
clean → Deletes the old target/ folder (removes previous compiled classes, reports, JAR/WAR).
compile → Compiles your automation code under src/main/java and src/test/java.
test → Runs your test classes (usually under src/test/java) using TestNG/JUnit.
	Browser launches.
	Test cases execute.
	Reports/logs/screenshots are generated.
package →
	Creates a JAR file of your automation project.
	By default → target/myproject-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
	
	
🔹 But why package an automation project?
Even though you don’t deploy automation like a web app, packaging has uses:
Executable JAR (with tests) → Can run your automation suite with:
	java -jar target/myproject-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

Sharing → The packaged JAR can be shared with others (like a library of reusable automation utilities).
Integration with CI/CD → CI tools (Jenkins, GitHub Actions) use the packaged artifact to run tests consistently.
Dependency Management → If you build a custom test utility library, packaging allows other projects to include it via Maven.

🔹 After package execution in automation
Once the package phase is done, you’ll have:
	target/ folder containing:
	Compiled classes (.class).
	Packaged JAR of your automation framework.
	Test reports (test-output/, surefire-reports/, Extent reports, screenshots).

Then in CI/CD (like Jenkins):
	That JAR or the compiled test classes are executed automatically.
	Reports are published for pass/fail results.
	
✅ In short for automation projects:
compile → compiles test code.
test → runs the automation scripts (Selenium, API tests).
package → bundles everything into a JAR so it can be executed or integrated with CI/CD.

Automation projects → package creates a JAR so tests + framework code can be run easily in CI/CD or shared.
Dev projects →
	JAR → run a standalone Java app or use as a library in other projects.
	WAR → deploy web apps to servers (Tomcat, JBoss, etc.).
	EAR → deploy enterprise apps to big app servers.
👉 In short: automation = run tests, dev = run or deploy the application.

🔹 Different Types of Triggers in Jenkins
Jenkins jobs/pipelines can be triggered in multiple ways:

1. SCM (Source Code Management) Triggers
	Poll SCM → Jenkins checks Git (or other VCS) at intervals (like every 5 mins) for changes.
	Webhooks (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket) → Code push/PR automatically triggers Jenkins build (preferred over polling).

2. Time-Based Triggers (CRON)
	You can schedule builds using Jenkins’ cron syntax.
	Example: H/15 * * * * → run every 15 minutes.

3. Manual Triggers
	A user clicks "Build Now" button.
	Can also pass build parameters when triggering manually.

4. Upstream/Downstream Triggers
	One job triggers another.
	Example: Build job → Test job → Deploy job.

5. Remote Triggers (via API/URL)
	Jenkins job can be triggered externally using a URL with an authentication token.
	Example: a script or another system calls Jenkins REST API.

6. Post-Build Actions
	After one job finishes, it can trigger another job automatically.

7. Other Event-Based Triggers (Plugins)
	Build after other projects → chain jobs.
	Parameterized builds → triggered with custom inputs.
	External Plugins → e.g., trigger on JIRA update, Slack command, Docker push, etc.

✅ In short:
Jenkins triggers can be manual, scheduled, SCM-based, event-based, remote (API), or upstream/downstream.


In Jenkins:
🔹 Upstream Job
A job that runs before another job.
Example: Job A (build the application) is the upstream for Job B (run tests).

🔹 Downstream Job
A job that runs after another job finishes.
Example: Job B (tests) is the downstream of Job A (build).

✅ Simple Example:
Job A (Build) → compiles and packages code.
Job B (Test) → runs only after Job A succeeds.

Here:
Job A = Upstream
Job B = Downstream

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

🔹 Why not just 1 big job?
You can put everything (build, test, deploy) into one big job, but it becomes:
Hard to manage
Hard to debug (if it fails, you don’t know which stage exactly caused it)
Hard to reuse (maybe you want to run tests without building every time)
Less scalable

🔹 Why multiple jobs (upstream & downstream)?
Splitting into jobs gives flexibility:
Modularity → Each job does one thing well. Example:
Job A → Build
Job B → Test
Job C → Deploy
Reusability → Test job can be reused across multiple projects.
Parallelization → Different downstream jobs can run in parallel (e.g., UI tests + API tests).
Error Isolation → If build fails, test & deploy don’t run → saves time.
Approval Gates → You can put manual approvals between jobs (e.g., deploy only after manager approval).

✅ In short:
1 job = simple for small projects.
Multiple jobs = better for bigger projects (CI/CD pipelines) because it gives clarity, control, and scalability.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

🔹 Old way (earlier)
Teams created multiple Freestyle jobs.
Linked them with upstream/downstream triggers.
Example: Job A (Build) → Job B (Test) → Job C (Deploy).
Problem: messy, hard to maintain, poor visibility.

🔹 Current way (modern corporate practice)
Jenkins Pipelines (Pipeline-as-Code) are the standard.
Everything (build, test, deploy) is defined inside one Jenkinsfile in the repo.
Uses stages instead of multiple jobs.

👉 Example Jenkinsfile:
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean compile'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Package') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn package'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'scp target/myapp.war user@server:/opt/tomcat/webapps/'
            }
        }
    }
}

🔹 Why Pipelines are preferred?
Single view of entire flow (build → test → deploy).
Version-controlled (Jenkinsfile lives in GitHub along with code).
Easier to debug (logs per stage).
Parallel execution possible.
Scalable for microservices & large orgs.

✅ In short (corporate world):
Freestyle + upstream/downstream = legacy, still seen in some older projects.
Jenkins Pipeline (Jenkinsfile) = modern standard, used in most companies today.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
1️⃣ Webhooks: The Trigger
A webhook is like a “phone call” from your Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) to another service (like Jenkins) saying:
“Hey! Something happened—someone just pushed code.”
Example: You push code to the main branch → webhook fires → Jenkins gets notified → Jenkins starts a job automatically.
This removes the need for manual builds.


2️⃣ Jenkins: The Automation Server
Jenkins acts as the middleman that automates tasks like:
	Fetching the latest code
	Compiling it
	Running tests
	Creating artifacts (like JAR/WAR files)
	Deploying (optional)

Flow with webhook:
	Code committed → webhook triggers Jenkins job.
	Jenkins checks out the latest code from Git.
	Jenkins runs the build (Maven/Gradle/etc.) as per job configuration.
	
3️⃣ Maven: The Build Tool
Maven is what actually compiles your code and runs tests in Java projects. It knows what steps to do because of the POM file.
POM.xml (Project Object Model):
	Defines project details: dependencies, plugins, build instructions, test configurations.
Example:
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
        <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
        <version>4.14.0</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
Maven phases (like clean, compile, test, package) are what Jenkins runs to build your project.

4️⃣ Jenkins + Maven
When Jenkins runs a Maven project:
Jenkins calls Maven command: mvn clean test or mvn clean package.
Maven reads pom.xml → downloads dependencies → compiles → runs tests → packages code (e.g., creates .jar or .war).
Jenkins collects results → updates build status → can deploy or notify teams.

5️⃣ Putting it together

Sequence:
Developer pushes code → Git webhook → Jenkins job triggered → Jenkins runs Maven build → Maven reads POM → compiles/tests/packages → Jenkins shows results

Important points:
The .jar/.war generated by Maven can be used for deployment in production or staging.
Jenkins can also run other post-build steps (like sending Slack notifications, deploying to servers, etc.).
The POM is your recipe, Maven is the chef, and Jenkins is the restaurant that coordinates the whole workflow automatically.

💡 Analogy:
Webhook: Waiter telling the kitchen “new order!”

Jenkins: Kitchen manager coordinating the tasks
Maven: Chef following the recipe (POM)
Artifact (JAR/WAR): Finished dish ready to serve
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

How Jenkins get POM?

1️⃣ Job type
Usually, for Maven projects, we create a “Maven Project” job in Jenkins.
If it’s a freestyle job, we can still use Maven via the “Build” step, but Maven projects are cleaner for Java.

2️⃣ Where Jenkins knows about POM if its a Free Style JOB:
In a Jenkins Maven job or Freestyle job with Maven build step:
Source Code Management (SCM):
	You tell Jenkins where your Git repo is.
	Jenkins clones the repo.
	
Build Configuration / Build Step:
	You specify the location of pom.xml relative to the workspace (if it’s in the root, just leave it as pom.xml).
	Example in Freestyle Job:
	Build → Invoke top-level Maven targets → POM: pom.xml → Goals: clean test
	Example in Maven Job:
	Root POM: pom.xml
	Goals: clean package
Goals/Phases:
This is where you say what Maven should do: clean, compile, test, package, install, etc.

3️⃣ What happens internally
Jenkins takes your POM file from the repo and give it to Maven.
Maven reads it → knows dependencies, plugins, test configurations → runs the commands you specified.
The resulting .jar or .war is stored in Jenkins workspace or archived as build artifact.

✅ Quick note:
You don’t upload POM manually anywhere. Jenkins always fetches it from your Git repo during the build.
The job just points to the location of POM inside that repo.


If its PIPELINE:

in a Jenkins Pipeline (Declarative or Scripted), you don’t manually “upload” the POM anywhere either. The POM always comes from the Git repo you check out in the pipeline.
Here’s how it works:
1
️⃣ Checkout stage:
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git url: 'https://github.com/your/repo.git', branch: 'main'
            }
        }

Jenkins clones your repo.
The pom.xml now exists in the workspace.

2️⃣ Build stage (Maven):
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                // Run Maven using the POM in the workspace
                sh 'mvn clean package'
            }
        }

Maven automatically finds pom.xml in the current directory.
If it’s somewhere else, you can specify it:
	mvn -f path/to/pom.xml clean package

3️⃣ Key points:
No manual POM upload needed.
Pipeline just tells Maven what goals/phases to run.
The POM from your repo defines dependencies, plugins, tests, etc.
Pipeline can also archive artifacts, run tests, deploy, etc.

💡 Analogy:
In Freestyle, you point Jenkins UI to pom.xml.
In Pipeline, you tell Maven (via shell or withMaven) to use the POM already in the workspace.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>1️⃣ Jenkins Master and Agents

Jenkins can run jobs on the Master itself or on remote agents/slaves.
For remote agents, Master needs to connect securely without typing passwords each time.

2️⃣ Why ssh-keygen on Master
When you set up SSH-based connections to agents or Git repositories, Jenkins Master needs a key pair:
Private key → stays on Jenkins Master
Public key → goes to the remote agent/server or GitHub/GitLab
The ssh-keygen -t rsa command generates this key pair.


3️⃣ Common Jenkins use cases
Connecting to GitHub/GitLab:
	Instead of entering username/password every time, Jenkins Master uses SSH keys to clone repos.
	You put the id_rsa.pub into GitHub → Jenkins can pull code automatically.

Connecting to remote Jenkins agents:
	SSH keys allow Master to trigger builds on agents securely.

Deployment or remote commands:
	Jenkins jobs often need to run scripts on remote servers. SSH keys allow passwordless login for automation.
	
1️⃣ What is SSH?
SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol to securely connect to another computer/server over a network.
Instead of using a password every time, SSH can use key pairs (public/private) for authentication.

2️⃣ What is ssh-keygen?
ssh-keygen is a command-line tool to generate SSH key pairs.
A key pair has:
Private key → stays on your machine, never share it
Public key → you can copy to any server you want to connect to

Stpes to generate ssh keys ot connect t Jenkins agent from Jenkins Master:
You run it on the Jenkins Master machine (the server where Jenkins is installed).
Usually in terminal/SSH session of the Master.
Example command:
	ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "jenkins-master"
	
2️⃣ During key generation
It will ask:
Enter file in which to save the key (/var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/id_rsa):
Default location: /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/id_rsa (for Linux)
Press Enter to accept default.
Then it will ask for a passphrase:
	For automation, leave it empty (so Jenkins can use it without prompting).
	
3️⃣ Files created
After running the command, you get two files in Jenkins user’s .ssh folder:
/var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/id_rsa       → Private key (keep secret!)
/var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/id_rsa.pub   → Public key (share with GitHub/agents)

Private key → stays on Jenkins Master, never share
Public key → copy to remote server/agent/GitHub

4️⃣ Copy public key
To GitHub / GitLab:
	Open the public key:
	cat /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Copy the whole content.
Go to GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG Keys → Add SSH key → Paste content.

To a remote server (for agents or deployment):
ssh-copy-id user@remote-server
Or manually append id_rsa.pub content to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the remote machine.

5️⃣ Permissions (important!)
.ssh folder:
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Makes sure Jenkins can read keys securely.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Summary:
1. Run ssh-keygen on Jenkins Master → creates id_rsa & id_rsa.pub
2. Keep private key on Master
3. Copy public key to:
   - GitHub/GitLab (for repo access)
   - Remote server/agent (for build or deployment)
4. Set correct permissions
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

1️⃣ Confirm SSH connection
From the Master, test the connection manually:
	ssh jenkins@agent-server
You should login without a password.
If this works, Jenkins can now control the agent.

2️⃣ Configure the agent in Jenkins
Go to Jenkins Dashboard → Manage Jenkins → Manage Nodes and Clouds → New Node
Give it a name → choose Permanent Agent → OK
Configure:
	Remote root directory: Where Jenkins stores job files on the agent, e.g., /home/jenkins
	Launch method: Launch agents via SSH
	Host: IP or hostname of agent
	Credentials: Add SSH credentials (use the private key generated on Master)

3️⃣ Set credentials
Add a new credential in Jenkins:
Kind: SSH Username with private key
Username: jenkins (agent user)
Private Key: Choose Enter directly and paste the private key (id_rsa) from Master
Save

4️⃣ Test connection
Click “Test Connection”
Jenkins should connect to the agent → shows success.

5️⃣ Agent ready for builds
Now the Master can schedule jobs on this agent:
Checkout code
Run Maven/Gradle builds
Execute scripts
Archive artifacts
Everything Jenkins does on the agent now is automated via SSH.

6️⃣ Optional setup on agent
Make sure agent has:
Java installed (java -version)
Maven installed (if needed)
Correct permissions for Jenkins user
Jenkins will use SSH to start an agent process that communicates back to Master.

💡 Analogy:
Master = boss
Agent = worker
SSH key = boss’s badge to get into worker’s office
Once inside, boss (Master) can assign tasks (build jobs) automatically

1️⃣ CI (Continuous Integration)
Purpose: Compile, test, and package your code whenever someone commits.
Job type: Usually a Jenkins job (Pipeline or Freestyle).

Flow:
Developer pushes code → webhook triggers Jenkins CI job
Jenkins checks out code → runs Maven build
mvn clean test → runs tests
mvn package → creates artifact (.jar, .war, .zip)
Jenkins archives this artifact or stores it in a repository (like Nexus, Artifactory, or even Jenkins workspace)

Output of CI:
A package/artifact that contains the built application
This package is ready for deployment

2️⃣ CD (Continuous Deployment / Delivery)
Purpose: Take the artifact from CI and deploy it to environments (dev, QA, staging, prod).
Job type: Separate Jenkins job or next stage in pipeline

Flow:
CD job picks up the artifact from:
Jenkins workspace
Artifact repository (Nexus, Artifactory)
CD job runs deployment scripts:
Copy artifact to server
Stop old service / start new service
Run any DB migrations or configuration changes

Post-deployment checks (optional):
Smoke test
Health check

Output of CD:
Deployed application running on target environment

3️⃣ How CI and CD connect
CI generates the artifact → archives it → triggers CD job or pipeline stage
CD consumes this artifact as input for deployment
	Code commit → CI job → Build & Test → Package (.jar/.war) → Archive → CD job → Deploy to server → Validate

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
where the artifact (JAR/WAR) actually goes when deployed:
1️⃣ Deployment target depends on your app type
	Java Web Application (WAR) → usually deployed to a web server or application server:
	Apache Tomcat (most common for WAR files)
	JBoss / WildFly / GlassFish (other Java app servers)
	Spring Boot / standalone Java app (JAR) → can be deployed directly on a server (Linux/Windows) and run with java -jar app.jar.

Install tomcat in agent
Copy your .war file from CI (Jenkins workspace or artifact repo) to Tomcat’s webapps folder:
Start/restart Tomcat to pick up the new app:
	ssh user@server "/opt/tomcat/bin/shutdown.sh"
	ssh user@server "/opt/tomcat/bin/startup.sh"
Tomcat automatically explodes the WAR into a folder and serves the app.

1️⃣ CI/CD vs Automation Testing:
| Aspect              | App Deployment (CI/CD)       | Automation Testing                     |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Artifact            | WAR/JAR packaged by Maven    | Usually test scripts or framework code |
| Target environment  | Tomcat / server / production | Test environment / test machine        |
| Goal                | Deploy app for users         | Run tests against an application       |
| CD server required? | Yes, deploy to server        | No, just run tests on remote/agent     |

2️⃣ How automation works
Jenkins job / pipeline triggers tests
Can be via webhook (push to repo) or scheduled (cron / nightly)
Jenkins Master or Agent executes test scripts
Scripts can be Selenium, TestNG, Cypress, etc.
Maven is used to compile + run tests, not to create deployable artifacts
Test environment setup
The application under test (AUT) is already running on a server / URL
You don’t deploy the AUT from Jenkins; tests just hit the running app

3️⃣ Remote machine / Agent execution
If using remote agents:
Jenkins Master triggers job
Agent pulls code / framework from repo
Agent executes tests using Maven or Gradle
Results sent back to Master (reports, logs, screenshots)
No Tomcat installation required unless your tests need a local server environment.

4️⃣ Artifact in automation testing
In automation jobs, the “artifact” is usually:
Test reports (HTML / XML / screenshots)
Logs
Sometimes test data files
You archive these in Jenkins workspace or artifact repo for reference.

✅ Key points
CI/CD builds + deploys an app → tests run on deployed app
In automation, Jenkins just triggers the test code → runs tests on agent → collects results
Remote machine = where tests execute, but no WAR/JAR deployment is needed

💡 Analogy:
App deployment = putting a new show on stage for the audience
Automation = sending reviewers to the stage to check the show without changing it

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>..

1️⃣ Java Web Application (WAR)
If your code is a web application packaged as a WAR, yes:
You deploy the WAR to Tomcat (or another servlet container).
Tomcat “explodes” the WAR → runs your servlets, JSPs, and backend code.
Your META-INF/context.xml is read by Tomcat for environment setup (like DB connections).
Users access the app via a browser → Tomcat serves the pages.

2️⃣ Automation testing code (Selenium, TestNG)
Your automation code is not deployed to Tomcat.
Instead, it runs on Jenkins agents / your machine.
It interacts with an application running on Tomcat (or any other server) via a URL.

Flow for automation testing:
Tomcat server (running deployed app)
        ↑
    HTTP requests
        ↑
Selenium/TestNG code (on Jenkins agent)


Jenkins triggers the automation scripts → scripts open browser → hit app URLs → verify functionality
Tomcat just hosts the app; it doesn’t host your test scripts.

| Scenario                           | Code runs where?                 | Tomcat involvement                       |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Web application (WAR/JSP)          | On Tomcat                        | Runs your app                            |
| Automation tests (Selenium/TestNG) | On Jenkins agent / local machine | Only interacts with app hosted on Tomcat |

1. What is a Jenkins Pipeline?
A Jenkins Pipeline is a way to define your build, test, and deployment process as code.
It automates your CI/CD workflow and makes it repeatable, version-controlled, and robust.

Key Points:
Treats build, test, deploy as stages.
Can be stored in Jenkinsfile in your repo.
Supports parallel execution, conditional steps, and complex workflows.

2. Why Use a Pipeline?
Code as configuration: Version-controlled in Git.
Automation: No manual clicks; triggers automatically.
Visibility: Console output, logs, and stage visualization.
Scalability: Can handle multiple environments (dev, staging, prod).
Error handling: Can retry, notify, or fail gracefully.
Parallel execution: Run tests, builds, and deployments simultaneously.

3. Types of Jenkins Pipelines
Declarative Pipeline:
Simpler syntax.
Uses pipeline {} block.
Good for most CI/CD workflows.

Scripted Pipeline:
Groovy-based.
More flexible and programmable.
Useful for complex logic and custom scripts.

4. Creating a Jenkins Pipeline for Dev + Automation Project
Step 1: Create Pipeline Job
Jenkins Dashboard → New Item → Enter Job Name.
Select Pipeline → Click OK.

Step 2: Choose Pipeline Definition
Pipeline script from SCM (Recommended) → Reads Jenkinsfile from Git.
Pipeline script → Write directly in Jenkins UI (not ideal for version control).

Step 3: Jenkinsfile Example for Dev + Automation Project
pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        BASE_URL = "https://dev.example.com"
        REPORT_PATH = "target/surefire-reports"
    }

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git branch: 'develop', url: 'https://github.com/username/project.git'
            }
        }

        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean compile'
            }
        }

        stage('Run Unit Tests') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
            post {
                always {
                    junit '**/target/surefire-reports/*.xml'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Run Automation Tests') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn verify -Dtest=AutomationTests'
            }
        }

        stage('Archive Reports') {
            steps {
                archiveArtifacts artifacts: '**/target/surefire-reports/*.xml', allowEmptyArchive: true
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy to Dev') {
            when {
                branch 'develop'
            }
            steps {
                echo "Deploying to Dev environment..."
                // add deployment scripts here
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        success {
            echo "Pipeline completed successfully!"
        }
        failure {
            echo "Pipeline failed. Sending notification..."
            // Add email/Slack notification steps here
        }
    }
}

Step 4: Run Pipeline
Save the Jenkins job.
Click Build Now → Pipeline executes stages.
View stage visualization in Jenkins.

5. Best Practices
Keep Jenkinsfile in Git repo for version control.
Use parameterized pipelines to run different environments.
Separate unit tests, integration tests, and automation tests in stages.
Archive test reports and generate dashboards.
Add notifications for success/failure.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
1. Where to store the Jenkinsfile
The Jenkinsfile is stored in the same Git repository as your project.
Typically in the root folder or in a ci/ or jenkins/ directory.
Example structure:
project-repo/
├─ src/
├─ tests/
├─ pom.xml
└─ Jenkinsfile


Storing it in Git ensures version control and that every branch can have its own pipeline logic if needed.

2. How Jenkins reads the Jenkinsfile
When you create a Pipeline job in Jenkins, you select Pipeline script from SCM.
You provide:
Git repo URL
Branch (e.g., develop, main)
Path to Jenkinsfile (if not in root)
Jenkins will clone the repo and read the Jenkinsfile from the specified branch/path when it runs the job.

3. Who creates the Jenkinsfile
Usually, DevOps engineers or automation engineers create the initial Jenkinsfile.
Developers may update or tweak it if necessary (e.g., add new test stages).
It’s treated like code → versioned, reviewed, and maintained in Git.

4. How Jenkins fetches it
Jenkins job is triggered (manual, SCM change, or schedule).
Jenkins connects to the Git repo using the URL and credentials.
Jenkins checks out the branch.
Jenkins reads the Jenkinsfile and executes the stages defined inside.
You don’t copy the Jenkinsfile to Jenkins manually—it’s always pulled from Git.

5. Key Points
One Jenkinsfile per branch (optional: can have separate dev/staging/prod Jenkinsfiles).
Changes to Jenkinsfile go through Git → ensures reproducibility.
Jenkins executes the pipeline as code → no manual intervention required.
Example Scenario
Git repo: https://github.com/org/project.git
Branch: develop
Jenkins job: Pipeline → points to Jenkinsfile in develop branch
Jenkins triggers: SCM change detected → pulls latest develop branch → reads Jenkinsfile → runs pipeline stages (build, test, deploy to Dev).

✅ Interview Tip:
"The Jenkinsfile is stored in the Git repo with the project.
 Jenkins fetches it automatically when the job runs by checking out the repo/branch.
 DevOps or automation engineers usually create it, and it’s maintained like any other code.
 This ensures pipelines are version-controlled, reproducible, and branch-specific."

 What is an Agent in Jenkins Pipeline?
In Jenkins, an agent is a machine (node) where the pipeline runs.
Jenkins has a master (controller) and one or more agents (workers).
Agents can be physical servers, VMs, or containers.

What does label mean in a Jenkinsfile?
When you see something like:

pipeline {
    agent { label 'linux' }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean install'
            }
        }
    }
}


label 'linux' tells Jenkins:
👉 “Run this pipeline only on agents that have the label linux.”

Why labels are used?
Agents can have different OS, tools, or configs.
Example labels: windows, linux, docker, maven, qa, prod.
Helps ensure the job runs in the right environment.
